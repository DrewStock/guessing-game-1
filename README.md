Assignment from Class 04 | Code Fellows 201

Simple game asks four questions of the user. Yes/No answers are accepted in different forms (uppercase, lowercase, shorthand).

Correct answers are counted and reported at end of game. Correct answers are reported back and styled in disco red and written to the document.

One function asks question and receives response and tracks whether response was correct.

Another function displays images related to correct answers.

Works most nicely in Firefox. Second choice is Chrome, then Safari.
